## 🎓 Key Learnings

### November 15, 2024
- ✅ Separated learning repo from work repo (safety first!)
- ✅ SSH setup is one-time effort, huge time saver
- ✅ Playwright config is straightforward and well-documented
- ✅ BaseURL makes tests cleaner and more maintainable

### November 17, 2024
- ✅ Setup tests use `import { test as setup }` pattern
- ✅ Storage state saves cookies and localStorage for reuse
- ✅ Playwright codegen is excellent for finding selectors quickly
- ✅ Auth files should be in .gitignore (security best practice)
- ✅ Running tests in headed mode helps debug issues
- ✅ Console.log is useful for debugging test execution flow
- ✅ File paths matter - use relative paths from project root

### December 8, 2024
- ✅ Project dependencies control execution order (setup → tests)
- ✅ StorageState in config makes tests use saved authentication
- ✅ Spread operator (`...`) copies preset configurations
- ✅ Dependencies ensure prerequisites run before main tests
- ✅ Playwright Inspector is powerful for step-by-step debugging
- ✅ Understanding test execution flow is crucial for debugging
- ✅ Authentication reduces test time significantly (3x faster!)
- ✅ Systematic debugging: isolate variables, test one thing at a time
- ✅ Production-ready auth patterns save time in the long run

## 🌟 Motivational Tracker

> **"Code every day, even if just 30 minutes - consistency matters more than marathon sessions"**

**Streak:** 🔥 3 days  
**Next Milestone:** Complete Page Object Model (Blocks 7-10)  
**Target Date:** December 9, 2024  
**Completion:** 12% → Target 20% by end of next session

---

## 🎯 Next Session Preview

**Block 7-10: Page Object Model (60 minutes)**

You'll learn to:
- Organize test code professionally
- Create reusable page classes
- Separate test logic from page interactions
- Build maintainable test architecture

**Files you'll create:**
- `pages/LoginPage.ts` - Login actions
- `pages/ProductsPage.ts` - Product browsing
- `pages/CartPage.ts` - Cart operations
- `pages/CheckoutPage.ts` - Checkout flow

**Why this matters:**
- Reduces code duplication
- Makes tests easier to maintain
- Industry-standard pattern
- Scales to large test suites
