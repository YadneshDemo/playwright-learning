## 🎓 Key Learnings

### November 15, 2024
- ✅ Separated learning repo from work repo (safety first!)
- ✅ SSH setup is one-time effort, huge time saver
- ✅ Playwright config is straightforward and well-documented
- ✅ BaseURL makes tests cleaner and more maintainable

### November 17, 2024
- ✅ Setup tests use `import { test as setup }` pattern
- ✅ Storage state saves cookies and localStorage for reuse
- ✅ Playwright codegen is excellent for finding selectors quickly
- ✅ Auth files should be in .gitignore (security best practice)
- ✅ Running tests in headed mode helps debug issues
- ✅ Console.log is useful for debugging test execution flow
- ✅ File paths matter - use relative paths from project root
